// Import `fetchBaseQuery` and `createApi` from Redux Toolkit Query.

// `createApi` is used to define the API slice and manage API state.

// This serves as the default configuration for all API calls made through this API slice.

// Explanation of each component


// fetchBaseQuery:

// Acts as a wrapper for the native fetch API.
// Simplifies HTTP requests by automatically handling common configurations like base URL, headers, and authentication.
// Ensures all API requests are consistent and easy to manage.
// baseUrl: BASE_URL: Sets the root URL for API requests, so you don't have to repeat the base URL in every endpoint.


// createApi:

// The main function for defining and managing an API slice.
// Automatically generates hooks for interacting with the API endpoints (e.g., useGetProductsQuery).
// Handles API caching, state management, and request deduplication automatically.



// baseQuery:

// Specifies the default behavior for all API requests in this slice (e.g., where to send the requests, common headers).
// Reusability: By defining baseQuery, you donâ€™t have to redefine configurations like the base URL in every endpoint.



// tagTypes:

// Represents the types of data being cached (e.g., "Product", "Order").
// Helps manage cache invalidation and re-fetching.
// Ensures data stays consistent by automatically updating dependent queries when a tag is invalidated.



// endpoints:

// Defines the individual API operations (e.g., fetch, create, update, delete).
// Starts empty here (endpoints: () => ({})) but is designed to be extended by injecting specific endpoints later.




// Why use this structure?




// Centralized API Management:

// Keeps all API-related logic in one place.
// Reduces duplication by using a shared base query and configuration.



// Improved Code Organization:

// Separates concerns by clearly defining API interactions in the API slice.
// Makes it easier to maintain and scale as the application grows.



// Built-in Features:

// Automates caching, invalidation, and request deduplication.
// Provides ready-to-use hooks for interacting with the API, saving time and effort.

 
//  Scalability:

// Can be easily extended with new endpoints or configurations.
// Supports tagging to ensure data is kept fresh without unnecessary API calls.
